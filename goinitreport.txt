1.
Team Name: [TODO]
Team members:
	- Valentin Langer, ga27set@mytum.de
	- Till Müller, ga53kiz@mytum.de
Module: Onion (39943)

2.
Language: Go
Reasons:
	- efficient and statically typed
	- good learning resources
	- cute mascot
	- strong standard library (for basic networking and cryptography)
	- memory management is done automatically
	- includes formatting, building and testing resources
	- focused on networking and multithreaded tasks
	- straightforward way of using concurrency
	- Both team members have had limited exposure to Go and a keen on experiencing a new programming language used by one of the largest technology companies in the world
	- raises our prospects in the job market (-> TUM employability score!)
OS: GNU/Linux
Reasons: 
	- Free (as in "free speech") software 
	- easily programmable and we have experience with it
	- often used for server and software development applications
	- good integration with the Go environment

3.
Build environment: Build tools included with go, if necessary wrapped in Docker for a consistent environment

4.
 Tests: internal tools provided by Go? (unit tests, integration tests)
Quality Control: Create a program that sends many API requests to the application (parallel, bad ones, etc.); the application should not crash
Leverage the continuous integration tools provided by Gitlab to run tests automatically when an update is pushed
5. Available Libraries: 
    - All libraries provided by Go plus the ones we download
    - "net" for networking tasks
    - concurrency is provided by goroutines
    - cryptography using the "crypto" library
    - "bytes" for manipulating byte-slices
    - "time" for time-keeping tasks / timestamps
    - debugging facilities are provided by the "debugging" library
    - if we need to make systemcalls, this functionality is enabled by the "sys" library
    - For status in-/output the "text" library might come in useful
    - A suitable library to parse configuration ini files, possibly go-ini (https://github.com/go-ini/ini)
6. License: MIT, BSD, Mozilla, GPL2, GPL3, Creative Commons
	- Software should be open source to enable others to learn from our mistakes
	- We want to brag to potential future employers
	- Also, we do not intend to ever sell / otherwise financially benefit from this software

7. Previous programming experience
	- Both team members have had experience with programming in low-level languages (e.g. C) and networking (GRNVS lecture, iLab1)
	- Multithreading has been a part of PGdP (Praktikum Grundlagen der Programmierung)

8. Planned workload distribution
	- The team members intend to split up the work into parts that are as equal in the effort required to produce them as possible
	- Architecturial and design decisions will be discussed and made together
	- Pair programming will be a major part of the implementation phase
	- Either team member will review and test the code written by the other
